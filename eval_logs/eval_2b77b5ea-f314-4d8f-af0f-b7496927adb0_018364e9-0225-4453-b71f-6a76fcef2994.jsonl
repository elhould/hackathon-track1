I'm here to help you with Industrial Revolution.\n\n**What we'll explore today:**\nIn this session, we'll work through Industrial Revolution concepts together. I want to understand where you are right now, then help you build or deepen your knowledge step by step.\n\n**Quick check-in:**\n1. How comfortable do you feel with Industrial Revolution right now? (e.g., \"never heard of it\", \"a bit familiar\", \"pretty confident\")\n2. What have you already learned or tried about this topic?\n\n**Let's see what you know:**\nI'll ask you 3 quick questions to understand your starting point:\n\n**Question 1 (Basic):** What do we mean by the term \u201cIndustrial Revolution\u201d? (1\u20132 sentences)  \n**Question 2 (Intermediate):** Name one key invention or technology from the Industrial Revolution and explain how it changed work or production.  \n**Question 3 (Advanced):** In your view, what was the most important social consequence of industrialization (e.g., living conditions, class structure, child labor)\u2014and why?\n\nTake your time!

I'm actually pretty confident with this since I love history\u2014it's like a giant story about how the world changed its entire blueprint. \n\n1. It\u2019s that massive shift from making things by hand in cottages to using machines in factories, which basically flipped how society functioned starting in the late 1700s.\n2. The steam engine was the real game-changer; it was like a portable power source that meant factories didn't have to be stuck next to rivers anymore, so industry could basically explode anywhere.\n3. I think urbanization and the new class divide were the biggest consequences\u2014stuffing millions of people into cramped, soot-covered cities created this whole new \"working class\" that had to fight for basically every right we have today.\n\nDo we get to talk about the Luddites?

This connected every little town into a single massive market, and since you could move tons of stuff so efficiently, the cost of making and shipping things plummeted, making them cheaper for everyone.\n\nFor the second one, I\u2019d use a diary from a factory worker, because statistics can feel a bit cold and abstract.
