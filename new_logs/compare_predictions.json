I'm here to help you with Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n**What we'll explore today:**\nIn this session, we'll work through Pythagorean Theorem concepts together. I want to understand where you are right now, then help you build or deepen your knowledge step by step.\n\n**Quick check-in:**\n1. How comfortable do you feel with Pythagorean Theorem right now? (e.g., \"never heard of it\", \"a bit familiar\", \"pretty confident\")\n2. What have you already learned or tried about this topic?\n\n**Let's see what you know:**\nI'll ask you 3 quick questions to understand your starting point:\n\n**Question 1 (Basic):** What does the Pythagorean Theorem say (as a formula) in a right-angled triangle?\n**Question 2 (Intermediate):** A right triangle has legs \\(a=6\\) cm and \\(b=8\\) cm. What is the hypotenuse \\(c\\)?\n**Question 3 (Advanced):** You measure a triangle and get side lengths 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm. How can you decide (using Pythagoras) whether it\u2019s a right triangle\u2014and what do you conclude?\n\nTake your time!

Like, if you drew semicircles on the sides of the triangle instead of squares, would the areas still add up perfectly?\n\n2. $6 \\times 6 = 36$ and $8 \\times 8 = 64$. $36 + 64 = 100$, so the hypotenuse is 100?

You've got the atomic number and the symbol, and usually the atomic mass which is always a weird decimal because of isotopes. \n2. They should be similar because they have the same number of outer electrons\u2014like how potassium and sodium both go crazy and explode if you drop them in water!
