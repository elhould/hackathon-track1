I'm here to help you with Probability Basics.\n\n**What we'll explore today:**\nIn this session, we'll work through Probability Basics concepts together. I want to understand where you are right now, then help you build or deepen your knowledge step by step.\n\n**Quick check-in:**\n1. How comfortable do you feel with Probability Basics right now? (e.g., \"never heard of it\", \"a bit familiar\", \"pretty confident\")\n2. What have you already learned or tried about this topic?\n\n**Let's see what you know:**\nI'll ask you 3 quick questions to understand your starting point:\n\n**Question 1 (Basic):** What does \u201cprobability\u201d mean, and what is the probability of getting **heads** when flipping a fair coin once?  \n**Question 2 (Intermediate):** You roll a fair six-sided die once. What is the probability of rolling a number **greater than 4**, and how did you decide?  \n**Question 3 (Advanced):** A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls. You draw **two balls without replacement**. What is the probability that **both are red**? Explain your reasoning.\n\nTake your time! Just answer what you can \u2013 it's totally fine if some are tricky. \ud83d\ude0a\n---", "phase": "diagnostic", "response": {"conversation_id": "5a4e61e6-58d7-4e3b-8dbd-c4bb00051069", "interaction_id": "650bc24b-2738-40e3-a329-a7f1f7eab090", "student_response": "Hi!
