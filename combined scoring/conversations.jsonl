Adding a shell is like adding a whole new layer to an onion, so it definitely gets way bigger.

One more pinpoint: **Why doesn\u2019t electron\u2013electron repulsion \u201cwin\u201d across a period?** Choose the best explanation (and add 1 short reason):\n- A) Because the *new electrons go into the same main energy level (same shell)*, so they don\u2019t add much extra shielding, while nuclear charge increases each step.\n- B) Because electrons don\u2019t repel each other much inside atoms.\n- C) Because the atomic mass increase makes atoms smaller.\n\n2) Quick application: Compare **Mg** and **Cl** (both in period 3).
